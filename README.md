It would be awesome to implement [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) into Minecraft as a Mod where you can talk to villagers and have a model that can watch your world and provide context to the player about what is happening in their world.

## Goals
* [ ] Implement Ollama into minecraft to interact with the player (kind of like an AI pal)
  * [ ] World Events context
  * [ ] Nearby villages context
  * [ ] Village context
    * For example, village was attacked my mobs, village built iron golem, village was raided
  * [ ] Villager context
    * For example, a villager can see a player, villager's friend died in the middle of the night
    * **NOTE**: Conversations likely limited to villagers with jobs 

## Mod vs Plugin?
* A ModPack will disassemble and assemble the game code to add something new into it when building the game.
* A Plugin respects the game code but adds on top of it, it can modify in this tree:
  * data
    * (namespace)
      * advancements (*.json)
      * functions (*.mcfunction)
      * item_modifiers (*.json)
      * loot_tables (*.json)
      * predicates (*.json)
      * recipes (*.json)
      * structures (*.nbt)
